						<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
						<!-- one -->
						<h3>1. Welcome to 6FUTURE</h3>
						<p class="p">Welcome to 6FUTURE. By using this website (the “Site”) and services (together with the Site, the “Services”) offered by 6FUTURE, PBC (together with its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, consultants, employees, officers, and directors — collectively, “6FUTURE,” “we,” or “us”), you’re agreeing to these legally binding rules (the “Terms”). You’re also agreeing to our Privacy Policy and agreeing to follow any other rules on the Site, like our Community Guidelines and rules for starting projects.<br><br>
						We may change these terms from time to time. If we do, we’ll let you know about any material changes, either by notifying you on the Site or by sending you an email. New versions of the terms will never apply retroactively — we’ll tell you the exact date they go into effect. If you keep using 6FUTURE after a change, that means you accept the new terms.<br><br>
						6FUTURE is for your personal, non-commercial use, except as explained in section 4 and section 5 below.</p>
						<!-- two -->
						<h3>2. About Creating an Account</h3>
						<p class="p">You can browse 6FUTURE without registering for an account. But to use some of 6FUTURE’s functions, you’ll need to register, choose an account name, and set a password. When you do that, the information you give us has to be accurate and complete. Don’t impersonate anyone else or choose names that are offensive or that violate anyone’s rights. If you don’t follow these rules, we may cancel your account.<br><br>
						You’re responsible for all the activity on your account, and for keeping your password confidential. If you find out that someone’s used your account without your permission, you should report it to <a href="">support@k6FUTURE.com.</a> <br><br>
						To sign up for an account, you need to be at least 18 years old, or old enough to form a binding contract where you live. If necessary, we may ask you for proof of age.</p>
						<!-- three -->
						<h3>3. Things You Definitely Shouldn’t Do</h3>
						<p class="p-next">Millions of people use 6FUTURE. We expect all of them to behave responsibly and help keep this a nice place. Don’t do any of these things on the Site:</p>
						<ul class="faq">
							<li>
								<p>Don’t break the law. Don’t take any action that infringes or violates other people’s rights, violates the law, or breaches any contract or legal duty you have toward anyone.</p>	
								<p>Don’t lie to people. Don’t post information you know is false, misleading, or inaccurate. Don’t do anything deceptive or fraudulent.</p>	
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Don’t offer prohibited items. Don’t offer any rewards that are illegal, violate any of 6FUTURE’s policies, rules, or guidelines, or violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance, or regulation.</p>
								<p>Don’t victimize anyone. Don’t do anything threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, libelous, tortious, obscene, profane, or invasive of another person’s privacy.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<!-- four -->
						<h3>4. How Projects Work</h3>
						<p class="p">6FUTURE provides a funding platform for creative projects. When a creator posts a project on FUTURE, they’re inviting other people to form a contract with them. Anyone who backs a project is accepting the creator’s offer, and forming that contract.
						6FUTURE is not a part of this contract — the contract is a direct legal agreement between creators and their backers. Here are the terms that govern that agreement:<br><br>
						When a project is successfully funded, the creator must complete the project and fulfill each reward. Once a creator has done so, they’ve satisfied their obligation to their backers.<br><br>
						Throughout the process, creators owe their backers a high standard of effort, honest communication, and a dedication to bringing the project to life. At the same time, backers must understand that when they back a project, they’re helping to create something new — not ordering something that already exists. There may be changes or delays, and there’s a chance something could happen that prevents the creator from being able to finish the project as promised.<br><br>
						If a creator is unable to complete their project and fulfill rewards, they’ve failed to live up to the basic obligations of this agreement. To right this, they must make every reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the project to the best possible conclusion for backers. A creator in this position has only remedied the situation and met their obligations to backers if:</p>
						<ul class="faq">
							<li>
								<p>they post an update that explains what work has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents them from finishing the project as planned;</p>	
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>they work diligently and in good faith to bring the project to the best possible conclusion in a timeframe that’s communicated to backers;</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>they’re able to demonstrate that they’ve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the project as promised;</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>they’ve been honest, and have made no material misrepresentations in their communication to backers; and</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>they offer to return any remaining funds to backers who have not received their reward (in proportion to the amounts pledged), or else explain how those funds will be used to complete the project in some alternate form.</p>
							</li>
							<p class="p-next">The creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their project. If they’re unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by backers.</p>
						</ul>
						<!-- five -->
						<h3>5. How Funding Works</h3>
						<p class="p-next">These are the terms that apply when you’re backing a project:</p>
						<ul class="faq">
							<li>
								<p>You’re only charged if the project reaches its fundraising goal. You’ll provide your payment information when you pledge, but you won’t be charged. Your payment will only be collected if, at the time of the project’s funding deadline, the project has reached its fundraising goal. The exact amount you pledged is the amount 6FUTURE will collect. If the campaign hasn’t reached its fundraising goal, you won’t be charged, no funds will be collected, and no money will change hands.</p>	
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>In some cases we’ll reserve the charge on your card. Kickstarter and its payment partners may authorize or reserve a charge on your credit card (or whatever payment method you use) for any amount up to the full pledge, at any time between the pledge and the collection of funds.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>You can change or cancel your pledge at any time before the project’s funding deadline (with one exception). You can increase, decrease, or cancel your pledge at any time during the campaign, with one exception. During the last 24 hours of the campaign, you can’t decrease or cancel your pledge without contacting customer support first — if that action would drop the project below its funding goal. Once the project has been funded, you can only cancel or change your pledge by making special arrangements directly with the creator.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>The Estimated Delivery Date is the creator’s estimate. The date listed on each reward is the creator’s estimate of when they will provide the reward — not a guarantee to fulfill by that date. The schedule may change as the creator works on the project. We ask creators to think carefully, set a date they feel confident they can work toward, and communicate with backers about any changes.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>The creator may need to send you questions about your reward. To deliver rewards, the creator might need information from you, like your mailing address or t-shirt size. They’ll request that information after the campaign has succeeded. To receive the reward, you’ll need to provide the information in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>6FUTURE doesn’t offer refunds. Responsibility for finishing a project lies entirely with the project creator. 6FUTURE doesn’t hold funds on creators’ behalf, cannot guarantee creators’ work, and does not offer refunds.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="p-next">These are the terms that apply when you’re creating a project:</p>
						<ul class="faq">
							<li>
								<p>You can refund individual pledges if you want. After your project has been funded, you can cancel and refund a backer’s pledge at any time. If you do, you have no further obligation to that specific backer, and no agreement exists between you.</p>	
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>We’ll charge our fees before putting funds in your account. 6FUTURE and its payment partners will subtract fees before transmitting the proceeds of a campaign.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Some pledges can’t be collected, which might reduce the amount of funding you get. Because some payments can’t be collected — for instance, when a backer’s credit card expires before funding ends, and they don’t provide updated information — we can’t guarantee that the amount of funding you receive will be exactly equal to the full amount pledged minus fees.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>We'll help resolve payment-card disputes. If a backer of your project disputes the charge with their card issuer, we'll handle re-presenting the charge to settle the dispute with the card issuer. You’ll be notified that a dispute has been filed, and you’ll be able to provide evidence to help us resolve it in your favor. If the cardholder’s dispute is found valid, you authorize us to charge the credit card number you provided when you started your project for the amount of the chargeback.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Don’t count your chickens before they hatch. Don’t assume you’ll be able to launch your project when you want; there could be a reason we’re not able to accept it, or a problem that takes time to resolve. Don’t assume you’ll be able to immediately collect your funding; there may be a delay between the end of a successful campaign and your access to the funds. And don’t take any actions in reliance on collecting any of the money pledged until you actually have the ability to withdraw it from your account and spend it.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p class="p">6FUTURE isn’t liable for any damages or losses related to your use of the Services.

						<h3>7. Our Fees</h3>
						<p class="p">Creating an account on 6FUTURE is free. If you create a project that is successfully funded, we (and our payment partners) collect fees. Our partners’ fees may vary slightly based on your location.<br><br>
						We will not collect any fees without giving you a chance to review and accept them. If our fees ever change, we’ll announce that on our Site.

We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to this indemnification clause, in which case you agree that you’ll cooperate and help us in asserting any defenses.</p>

						<!-- sixtheen -->
						<h3>16. Limitation of Liability</h3>
						<p class="p">To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will 6FUTURE, its directors, employees, partners, suppliers, or content providers be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, consequential, special, or exemplary damages of any kind, including but not limited to damages (i) resulting from your access to, use of, or inability to access or use the Services; (ii) for any lost profits, data loss, or cost of procurement or substitute goods or services; or (iii) for any conduct of content of any third party on the Site.

						<h3>17. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</h3>

						<!-- eighttheen -->
						<h3>18. The Rest</h3>
						<p class="p">These Terms and the other material referenced in them are the entire agreement between you and 6FUTURE with respect to the Services. They supersede all other communications and proposals (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you and 6FUTURE with respect to the Services and govern our future relationship. If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid under the law, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms otherwise will remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either you or Kickstarter to exercise any right provided for in these Terms in any way won’t be deemed a waiver of any other rights.<br><br>
						These Terms are personal to you. You can’t assign them, transfer them, or sublicense them unless you get 6FUTURE’s prior written consent. 6FUTURE has the right to assign, transfer, or delegate any of its rights and obligations under these Terms without your consent. Kickstarter will provide you notice via email, written notice, or by conspicuously posting the notice on our Site.</p>
