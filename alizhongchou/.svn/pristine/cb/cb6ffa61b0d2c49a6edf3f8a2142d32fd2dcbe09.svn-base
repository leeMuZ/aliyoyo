					<h3>Founded to Revolutionize Funding</h3>
					<p>
						When creative people work together, amazing things happen. Danae Ringelmann grew up seeing her parents struggle to get small business loans. In his spare time, Eric Schell attempted to help a Chicago theater company get funding. Slava Rubin fundraised for a cure for Myeloma, the disease that killed his father. They came together because they found a fundamental flaw in the system: for centuries, access to funding had been controlled by a select few. Your crazy, cool, genius ideas were getting stuck.
						<br><br>
						Danae, Eric, and Slava founded Indiegogo in 2008 to shift the power into your hands—to empower creative, entrepreneurial people everywhere to bring their ideas to life. We can’t wait to see what you create next.
