					<p class="p-zhengchang">We take our responsibility as Kickstarter's stewards very seriously. It's our job to provide a system deserving of your trust — by proactively screening for potential problems, by investigating issues brought to us by our community, and by still being exceedingly clear that even with these steps not every project will go as planned.<br><br>
					Our goal is to provide a safe and trusted platform where people are honest and open with one another as they collaborate to bring creative projects to life.</p>

					<p class="p-weight">What everyone should know</p>
					<p class="p-zhengchang">6FUTURE is not a store. People aren't buying things that already exist — they're helping to create new things. Creating things isn't always easy. Some projects will go wonderfully, and others will run into obstacles. Be prepared for a little bit of each.<br><br>
					We monitor the system. Our Integrity team uses complex algorithms and automated tools to identify and investigate suspicious activity on projects.<br><br>
					We take action. Sometimes that just means asking someone to fix a problem. But when we find users or projects that abuse the system, we don't hesitate to suspend them.</p>
					<p class="blue-p"></p>

					<p class="p-weight">What backers can do</p>
					<p class="p-zhengchang">Explore the project page. It should tell you everything you need to know, including details about the project and information — including a Verified Name — about the creator who's vouching for it. Don't forget to read the comments (to see what others are saying) and any updates (to see how the creator communicates with backers). The "Risks and Challenges" section is especially worth a look.<br><br>
					Read what others say. If you're not sure about something, you can look elsewhere on the web. Does the creator have an online presence, or past work you can look at? Do people say good things about them? If you're curious about the thing they're creating, you can look into that, too. Has it been tried before? What happened then?<br><br>
					Ask questions. If there's something you want to know about a project, ask the creator — there's an "ask" button at the bottom of each project page. And if you come across anything suspicious, just let us know — there's a “report this project” button on each page. That feedback helps us make sure no one's trying to abuse the system.</p>
					<p class="blue-p"></p>
					<!--  -->
					<p class="p-weight">What creators can do</p>
					<p class="p-zhengchang">Be open and responsive. Let people know all about who you are and what you want to accomplish. And do your best to answer backers' questions and address their concerns, quickly and thoroughly — it's a great way to show people that you’re reliable, available, and committed to your project.<br><br>
					Be honest and ethical. It’s tempting to "sell" your project with glossy pitches and big promises, but backers can trust you much more when you're straightforward and honest. Give them a real look at your work, and be frank about the risks and challenges. Don’t try to game the system or make your project look more popular than it is — creators who try things like self-funding and other pledging schemes are at risk of having their projects suspended.<br><br>
					Only work with trusted partners. If you’re collaborating with a group of people, make sure the Verified Name for your project is a trusted contributor, and be cautious about sharing one password. Instead, use the collaborators tool to grant teammates access to help with your project through their own account. If someone approaches you with offers to promote or market your project, remember that Kickstarter does not endorse or have any affiliation with such services. If you do think about contracting one, use these tips to vet what they're offering or visit this conversation to learn about other creators' experiences with these services. If the service sends spam messages or distributes lists of backers' emails, you'll be held accountable, and your project could be suspended.</p>

					<p class="p-weight">What we do</p>
					<p class="p-zhengchang">We listen. We didn't just build Kickstarter — we've been lovingly tending to it since we launched in 2009. Our Integrity team is always watching over the platform and reviewing reports from the community. Our community helps us make sure this is the safest, most effective platform around.<br><br>
					We monitor the system. Our Integrity team uses complex algorithms and automated tools to identify and investigate suspicious activity on projects.<br><br>
					We take action. Sometimes that just means asking someone to fix a problem. But when we find users or projects that abuse the system, we don't hesitate to suspend them.</p>

					<p class="p-weight">General security tips</p>
					<p class="p-zhengchang">Protect your information. Be careful what information you post in public parts of the internet, and keep sensitive data close. If you’re ever unsure which parts of 6FUTURE are public, our <a href="">Privacy Policy</a>can help.<br><br>
					Beware of "phishing." Phishing is when someone pretends to be a business you trust and asks for sensitive information. Kickstarter will never ask for your Social Security number or full payment information over the phone or by email, and the only place we'll ask you to enter your password is on Kickstarter's log-in screen. If anyone asks you for this information, or you think you've received a scam or hoax email from someone pretending to be affiliated with us, don't respond — just let us know.<br><br>
					Use our security tools. Turning on Two-Factor Authentication makes your account more secure by adding another step to your log-in procedure. And the Login History in your account settings lets you see every time and place your account was accessed, so you can double-check that everything’s safe.</p>
