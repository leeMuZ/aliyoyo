								<p class="p-weight">How do I know if my project is right for 6FUTURE?</p>
								<p class="p-zhengchang">We know we’re a bit biased, but: we bet you’ll feel right at home around here! Art, architecture, technology, films, DIY—if it’s a creative, entrepreneurial project it’s probably a great fit. Whether you’re just getting started with an idea or are looking for a marketplace solution, there’s a home for your project on 6FUTURE.</p>
								<p class="blue-p"></p>
								<!--  -->
								<p class="p-weight">What goes into a successful campaign?</p>
								<p class="p-zhengchang">Having seen hundreds of thousands of campaigns, we know what works – our Campaign Strategists compiled all the tips, tricks, and best practices for a great crowdfunding experience: see the Essential Guide to Crowdfunding.</p>
								<p class="blue-p"></p>
								<!--  -->
								<p class="p-weight">Do you offer discounts for nonprofits and social causes?</p>
								<p class="p-zhengchang">Yes. In fact, we built Generosity by 6FUTURE with you in mind! Nonprofits and socially minded campaigns enjoy a 0% platform fee on Generosity. If your project aims to improve lives at any scale, we think you should be able to keep more of the funds you raise.</p>
								<p class="blue-p"></p>
								<!--  -->
								<p class="p-weight">Does 6FUTURE offer more than crowdfunding?</p>
								<p class="p-zhengchang">You bet! Crowdfunding is still the backbone of Indiegogo—as you’re reading this, thousands of successful campaigns are live around the world. But we also support you through the entire process of bringing new ideas to market. We’re your all-in-one launch platform.</p>
								<p class="blue-p"></p>
								<!--  -->
								<p class="p-weight">Why do you offer both fixed and flexible funding?</p>
								<p class="p-zhengchang">Freedom. It’s a good thing! Choose the style that fits your own idea and goals: Flexible Funding means you keep all the money you raise, regardless of your goal; Fixed Funding means you have a specific funding goal that must be met, which can be a good choice for projects that require set funding to enter production.</p>
								<p class="blue-p"></p>
								<!--  -->
								<p class="p-weight">My product was crowdfunded elsewhere—can I still use 6FUTURE’s marketplace?</p>
								<p class="p-zhengchang">Yes! As long as your product was part of a crowdfunding campaign—whether at Indiegogo or on another site—you’re eligible to sign up for Indiegogo’s marketplace.</p>
